## tomorrow (today) produces a string value of the day after today with a input
##    of today. If a string value does not belong in a week, produce unknown.

## tomorrow: Str -> (anyof "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" "Thursday" "Friday"
##       "Saturday" "Sunday" "Unknown")
## required: today = Any of String

#Examples: tomorrow("MoNday") -> "Tuesday"
#          tomorrow("TuesDay") -> "Wednesday"
#          tomorrow("MyBirthday") -> "Unknown"
